Escape the Big Rip
==================

The Universe is expanding faster and faster, the [Big Rip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip) is near. Your only chance: You have to run from it... *Run Out Of Space*!

Controls
--------

Your space ship contains a highly experimental FTL drive, with a twist: You cannot maneuver arbitrarely. Instead, your ship is permanently moving forward, while also moving perpendicular to that direction. The orientation of that additional movement can be toggled, this requires energy. That energy refills automatically, but slowly, if you find energy sources, you can also refill it quicker. Toggling is controlled by the space bar, but be careful not to... *Run Out Of Space*!
